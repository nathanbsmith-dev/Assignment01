# Assignment 1

## Overview
This assignment involves creating a basic HTML5 document linked to an external JavaScript file, completing various JavaScript exercises, and uploading the project to a GitHub repository.

## Steps to Complete the Assignment

### 1. Set Up the Repository
1. Create a new GitHub repository named `Assignment01`.
2. Clone the repository to your local computer.
3. Open the folder in Visual Studio Code.

### 2. Create HTML and JavaScript Files
1. Create an `index.html` file and add the necessary HTML5 boilerplate.
2. Set the document title to **Assignment 1**.
3. Create a `js` folder.
4. Inside the `js` folder, create a JavaScript file named `script.js`.
5. Link `script.js` to `index.html`.

### 3. Implement JavaScript Exercises
All exercises should be completed within `script.js`, with each step clearly commented out after completion.

#### JavaScript Tasks:
- Convert the given identifiers to Camel Case notation.
- Create examples of numeric, string, Boolean, and null literal expressions.
- Create complex expressions.
- Declare 9 variables using Camel Case and Hungarian Notation.
- Assign values to 3 of those variables using different methods.
- Demonstrate type coercion by adding a number and a string.
- Work with Boolean and string coercion.
- Correct an invalid string literal.
- Assign and display `null` and `undefined` values.
- Use the `typeof` operator to check variable types.
- Display concatenated text in an alert box.
- Prompt the user for their name and course, then display a welcome message.
- Perform arithmetic operations and assignment.
- Use comparison and logical operators to evaluate true and false expressions.

### 4. Commenting the Code
- Every step should be implemented and tested before being commented out.
- Steps should remain in the script but commented out when the final version is pushed to GitHub.

### 5. Push to GitHub
1. Add all files to the repository:
   ```sh
   git add .
   ```
2. Commit the changes:
   ```sh
   git commit -m "Completed Assignment 1"
   ```
3. Push the changes to GitHub:
   ```sh
   git push origin main
   ```

## Submission
Submit the GitHub repository URL containing `index.html`, `script.js`, and this `README.md` file.
